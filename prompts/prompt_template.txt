        Please convert the following text into standard Markdown format. Ensure that the content and meaning remain unchanged while optimizing the structure and format.

        Requirements:
        Only adjust the format where necessary to comply with standard Markdown syntax.
        Ensure that the Markdown structure is logically consistent. Avoid logical errors.
        When rewriting the text, feel free to use any appropriate Markdown elements to enhance the structure and readability. Below are some reference elements:
        Headings (#, ##, ###, etc.)
        Lists (-, *, 1., 2., etc.)
        Bold (text)
        Code blocks and inline code (code, code block)
        Math blocks and inline math (...for blocks, $...$ for inline)
        Links (text)
        Italics (text or text)
        Blockquotes (>)
        Horizontal rules (--- or ***)
        Images ()
        The goal is to convert the text into standard Markdown format without altering the original content's meaning.
        Do not wrap the output in a single markdown code block.
